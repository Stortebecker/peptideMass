Author: Florian Christoph Sigloch
Maintainer: Florian Christoph Sigloch <sigloch@polyquant.com>
Description: The package includes a single function to calculate masses of proteins and peptides with stable isotope labels. 
Stable isotope labels are commonly used in proteomics to be able to discriminate a standard from an endogeneous peptide.
The package is a supposed to be a remake of the mass calculation in the ExPASy tool 'PeptideMass', but including more options for common labels like SILAC and 15N.
